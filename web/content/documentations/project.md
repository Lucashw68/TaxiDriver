## Subject
You are asked to solve the Taxi-v3 game, in which the environment can be found in the Gym library.
The agent is a taxi that must pick up a passenger present in a random location on the map, and drop them
off in one of four possible locations.
You must solve this problem with an optimized model-free episodic learning algorithm.

The program should output the mean time for finishing the game and the mean rewards within all the
episodes. It should also display random episodes.
To prove your algorithm performances, you must benchmark it against as many metrics as possible, playing
around with several parameters and rewards definition.
To do so, you are expected to develop a naive bruteforce algorithm as a comparaison point.
